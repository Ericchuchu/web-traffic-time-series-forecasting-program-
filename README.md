Forecast future traffic to Wikipedia pages by using deep learning model LSTM 

This is a competition on Kaggle 
(reference link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/discussion/43795)

## Description
This competition focuses on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series, as it has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically, we aim the competition at testing state-of-the-art methods designed by the participants, on the problem of forecasting future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles.

## Evaiuation
Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. the competition define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.

## Final grade
got the grade of 42 using my own predict sequence model
